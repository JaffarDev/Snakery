        sets the surface color to the color in parameter
		store the surface's rect

main():
    initialize the game
    start the snake with a fixed length
    create a spritegroup for food (to check collision with head)
    create a spritegroup for all sprites (for easy rendering)
	create an event to spawn food at regular intervals
	gameLoop() {
		deal with events
		get keys pressed and pass the them to the change_dir function
		move the snake
		check for collision with food, when head collides with food, the food is destroyed and the snake grows 
		check for collision with body, game ends and user can play again
		render the sprites
		lock the framerate at 15 fps
